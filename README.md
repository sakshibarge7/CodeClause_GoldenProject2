# Price Recommendation for Online Sellers (Code Clause)

Price Recommendation for Online Sellers lets suppliers compare their prices with other vendors’ prices for the same or similar products. In terms of sales growth, it displays the impact that accepting price recommendations has had at both the product and the overall level.

They can filter products based on item category and/or sales numbers (“Top Selling”, “Low Selling” or “Non Selling”). To help them make an informed decision, we also display the transfer price, i.e., the amount that they will receive after accounting for logistics.

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from kaggel with the link mentioned below: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data?resource=download

Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data. However, The UCI Machine Learning Repository has made this dataset containing actual transactions from 2010 and 2011. The dataset is maintained on their site, where it can be found by the title "Online Retail".
